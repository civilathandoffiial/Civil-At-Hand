Every person's circumstances are unique, and government requirements can vary based on factors we may not be aware of.</p>

                <li>Contact relevant authorities directly for confirmation when needed</li>
                <li>Stay informed about policy changes that might affect your situation</li>
                <li>Seek professional help for complex or high-stakes matters</li>
            </ul>
